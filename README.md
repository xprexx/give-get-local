# GiveLocal SG

**GiveLocal SG solves the donation disconnect.** Our verified, request-based marketplace matches household surplus to real community needs, streamlining logistics and eliminating waste.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for our project came from a practical problem faced by one of our team members. He had a large amount of unused clothing at home but no clear or convenient way to donate it. This highlighted a broader issue: many people want to give away usable items but lack a centralised platform to guide them on where and how to donate. From this starting point, the concept of a unified donation app emerged.

## What It Does

GiveLocal provides a centralised ecosystem for charitable contributions, enabling users to:

- **Donate unused items** – List items you no longer need for others to claim
- **Browse available donations** – Find items listed by other community members
- **Request specific items** – Verified beneficiaries can post item requests based on their needs
- **Support bulk donations** – Individuals and groups can give in larger quantities with minimal friction
- **Volunteer for events** – Sign up for volunteer opportunities hosted by verified organizations
- **Contribute to crowdfunding campaigns** – Support community causes financially

Beneficiary organizations can create verified accounts to post item requests, ensuring transparency and relevance in what they accept.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, edge functions, real-time subscriptions)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for native mobile builds

## Challenges We Ran Into

We faced several challenges during development, particularly when deciding which features to include. We resolved these discussions by presenting our viewpoints, evaluating their impact, and making decisions through majority vote.

At various points, we also encountered UI/UX issues. Our initial designs did not feel intuitive during testing. To address this, we sought feedback from friends and family, representing potential users of the app. Their insights helped us refine the interface and improve the overall user experience.

## Accomplishments

We are proud to have built a fully functioning demo application within the hackathon timeframe. Our web app features a clean, appealing layout and resembles a production-ready platform suitable for real-world use. The system is also designed with scalability in mind, giving us the foundation to further develop it into a fully deployed application.

## What We Learned

We learned that developing a full-stack, fully functioning web application requires significant time, effort, and careful planning. Beyond building features, we must consider what user data needs to be stored, how it should be structured, and how to ensure proper data security.

We also realized that user experience plays an essential role. Every detail, from button placement to page flow, influences how well the idea is executed. Without thoughtful UX design, even a good concept can fail to deliver its intended impact.

## What's Next

We believe this app has strong potential to be used by people across Singapore. Our long-term plan is to develop a mobile version and refine the platform for real-world deployment.
